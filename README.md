CAD Files for Drishti's Retinal Camera System Prototype

## Concept
This on-the-go system was designed for clinics to be able to travel and test patients for __. We designed this system to be completely collapsable, such that it can fit into a standard size backpack. The basic purpose of this rig is to allow precise positioning of the __ (phone camera system) to any person's left and right eye such that the images can be efficiently fed into (our AI algorithm etc etc.) for _ diagnosis. The system is completely adjustable for all head sizes. Additionally, it is made of readily available components that can be purchased at many local hardware stores, and is designed for low-cost fabrication. All aseembly tools are common household tools or easily purchasable/rentable from a local hardware store. 

## CAD Design

All the CAD files are provided in ```.STL``` file types. They can be interactively viewed within Github by clicking the files. To view the final assembled CAD model, view [```Assembly.STL```](https://github.com/ayaanzhaque/Drishti-CAD/blob/main/Assembly.STL).

## Assembly

## Acknowledgement

This project was done in collaboration with Sajiv Shah. He assisted in the development and design of the CAD parts and 3D-printed the materials. He also helped to assemble the first prototype and write the instructional document.
