## Concept
This mobile, on-the-go system is designed for clinics in Bangladesh to screen patients for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using a smartphone camera with a retinal attachment. The purpose of this rig is to allow precise positioning of the smartphone to any patient's left and right eye such that the images can be efficiently fed into Drishti's AI algorithms for DR diagnosis. The system is completely adjustable for all head sizes. It is made of readily available components that can be purchased at many local hardware stores, and is designed for low-cost fabrication. All aseembly tools are common household tools or easily purchasable/rentable from a local hardware store. The 3D-printed components can be printed on low-end machines and with cheap PLA filament. We designed this system to be completely collapsable, such that it can fit into a standard size backpack.

Our initial prototype drawings and designs are shown below.

All the CAD files were designed in SOLIDWORKS and are provided both as [```.sldprt```](https://github.com/ayaanzhaque/Drishti-CAD/tree/main/sldprt) files and as ```.STL``` file types, which are viewable directly in github using the embedded 3D model viewer. To view the final assembled CAD model, view [```Assembly.STL```](https://github.com/ayaanzhaque/Drishti-CAD/blob/main/Assembly.STL). For specifics on which components to purchase, and which to 3D print, refer to the Assembly section.
