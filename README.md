CAD Files and Implementation Drishti's Retinal Camera System Prototype

## Concept
This mobile, on-the-go system is designed for clinics in Bangladesh to screen patients for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using a smartphone camera with a retinal attachment. The basic of this rig is to allow precise positioning of the smartphone to any patient's left and right eye such that the images can be efficiently fed into Drishti's AI algorithms for DR diagnosis. The system is completely adjustable for all head sizes. Additionally, it is made of readily available components that can be purchased at many local hardware stores, and is designed for low-cost fabrication. All aseembly tools are common household tools or easily purchasable/rentable from a local hardware store. The 3D-printed components can be printed on low-end machines and with low-cost PLA filament. We designed this system to be completely collapsable, such that it can fit into a standard size backpack.

Our initial prototype drawings and designs are shown below.

## CAD Design

All the CAD files were designed in SOLIDWORKS and are provided both as [```.sldprt```](https://github.com/ayaanzhaque/Drishti-CAD/tree/main/sldprt) files and as ```.STL``` file types, which are viewable directly in github using the embedded 3D model viewer. To view the final assembled CAD model, view [```Assembly.STL```](https://github.com/ayaanzhaque/Drishti-CAD/blob/main/Assembly.STL). For specifics on which components to purchase, and which to 3D print, refer to the Assembly section.

## Assembly

Use the [```drishti_build_docs.pdf```](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a8JFyQoVU5_NAgstF9vPS_4r04IjrmUe/view?usp=sharing) documentation file for instructions on how to build the retinal camera system. Please contact if file cannot be accessed.

## Acknowledgement

This project was done in collaboration with Sajiv Shah. He assisted in the development and design of the CAD parts and 3D-printed the materials. He also helped to assemble the first prototype and write the instructional document.
